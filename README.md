📦 Distributed Data Pipeline (WIP)

A modular Spring Boot + AWS event-driven data ingestion system

This repository contains a work-in-progress distributed data pipeline built using Java 21, Spring Boot 3, AWS SQS/S3, MySQL/PostgreSQL, and Docker.
The system is designed as a set of small, composable microservices that work together to fetch, process, store, and serve data in a scalable way.

This project is for demonstrating modern backend concepts:

Event-driven architecture

Message queues (SQS)

Containerized microservices

Cloud storage ingestion (S3)

Database loading and REST API exposure

Clean modular service boundaries
