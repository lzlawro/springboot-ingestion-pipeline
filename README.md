# 📦 Distributed Data Pipeline (WIP)

## A modular Spring Boot + AWS event-driven data ingestion system

This repository contains a **work-in-progress distributed data pipeline** built using:

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3**
- **AWS SQS / AWS S3**
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL**
- **Docker**

The system is designed as a set of small, composable **microservices** that work together to fetch, process, store, and serve data in a scalable way.

This project is ideal for learning or demonstrating modern backend concepts:

- **Event-driven architecture**
- **Message queues (AWS SQS)**
- **Containerized microservices**
- **Cloud storage ingestion (AWS S3)**
- **Database loading and REST API exposure**
- **Clean, modular service boundaries**
